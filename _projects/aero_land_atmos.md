title: Aerosols, Land Cover, and Clouds
description: Humans are driving changes in the aerosol environment <em>and</em> in land cover. These changes are usually studied separately, but understanding their interactions is important to fully assessing how clouds and precipitation might change in future worlds. My Ph.D. dissertation is funded by a <a href='https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/2022/06/bee-leung-receives-nasa-future-investigators-award/'>NASA FINESST award</a> that looks at land-aerosol-cloud interactions. I'm currently working on a satellite-based study of how deforestation in Southeast Asia drives changes in clouds, and how those changes are modulated by moisture and aerosol loading.
