title: Aerosols, Land Cover, and Clouds
description: Humans are driving changes in the aerosol environment <em>and</em> in land cover. My dissertation is funded by a NASA FINESST award that looks at land-aerosol-cloud interactions. I'm currently working on a satellite-based study of how deforestation in Southeast Asia drives changes in clouds, and how those changes are modulated by moisture and aerosol loading.
