title: Deforestation Impacts on Clouds
description: Changes to the aerosol environment and to land cover often happen at the same time. In Borneo, for example, replacement of tropical rainforests with palm oil plantations often occurs alongside <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145614/smoke-blankets-borneo#:~:text=After%20several%20relatively%20quiet%20fire,pall%20of%20thick%2C%20noxious%20smoke.">massive peatland fires</a>. These changes are usually studied separately, but understanding their interactions is important to get an accurate picture of future changes to clouds and precipitation. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GL107678">this GRL paper</a>, we used two decades of satellite observations to estimate the impact of deforestation in Southeast Asia on clouds. One important point is that we find the impact of deforestation is not uniform everywhere––environmental humidity and aerosol loading can be important modulators of land-atmosphere interactions.

We're currently working on understanding how deforestation impacts vary across the diurnal cycle, particularly in terms of how the spatial pattern of deforestation impacts the mesoscale flow.
