title: Mesoscale Heterogeneity
description: In the real world, aerosol emissions can be localized on mesoscales (i.e., on the order of 100km). I study how this spatial variability can drive mesoscale flows, including one we've termed the <b>"aerosol breeze"</b>, using idealized models and satellite case studies.
