title: Aerosol Breezes and Mesoscale Heterogeneity
description: In the real world, aerosol emissions can be localized on mesoscales (i.e., on the order of 100km) around urban areas, dust plumes, or large wildfires. The differing aerosol radiative effects between regions of high and low aerosol loading drives changes to the overall circulation. We've used idealized models and satellite case studies to study this phenomenon, which we call the <b>"aerosol breeze"</b>. Read more about aerosol breezes <a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37722-3'>in this paper</a>, where we also discuss how important it is to represent mesoscale aerosol gradients in GCMs to accurately assess aerosol-cloud interactions.
