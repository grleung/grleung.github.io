title: Resolving Convective Mass Flux Across Storm Types
description: As part of the <a href="incus.colostate.edu">NASA INCUS mission</a>, we are tracking millions of simulated clouds in a massive dataset from all over the tropics and subtropics to better understand controls on convective mass flux. Currently, we are looking at how atmospheric moisture impacts which storms drive the strongest vertical transport of air and how those relationships change across regions, storm morphology (e.g., organized versus isolated convection), and with the grid spacing used to simulate them. As our community moves towards global kilometer-scale models, our results have important implications for how well our current models are able to represent the strongest storms across the world.
