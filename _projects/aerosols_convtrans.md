title: Object-Based Approaches to Aerosol-Cloud Interactions
description: Not all clouds respond to changes in aerosol loadings in the same way. We study <em>which</em> clouds are most susceptible to aerosol-induced changes, by using new <a href='https://github.com/tobac-project/tobac'>cloud identification and tracking tools</a> to separate different cloud modes. We also investigate how aerosol-cloud interactions impact the convective transport of aerosols and which aerosols are removed from the atmosphere through rainout. In <a href='https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5263-2023'>this paper</a>, we showed that in more polluted environments, clouds are actually less able to regulate the aerosol loadings by rainout, so more aerosol is transported into the free troposphere.
