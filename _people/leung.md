I'm currently an <a href='https://facstaff.provost.wisc.edu/faculty-hiring-and-retention-resources/#anna-julia-cooper-postdoctoral-fellowship'>Anna Julia Cooper</a> fellow at the <a href='https://www.aos.wisc.edu'>Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS), University of Wisconsin - Madison</a>. I will be starting as an Assistant Professor at AOS in Fall 2026. <br/><br/>
I'm very passionate about science communication and justice in STEM, especially relating to the Global South. Outside of work, you can usually find me at the pottery studio, testing out a new recipe, or riding my bike somewhere pretty!
<br/><br/>
I received both my MS and my PhD from the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. Prior to that, I worked at the Manila Observatory. I got my BS in Physics (and a minor in creative writing) from the Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines. "
