I'm currently an <a href="https://facstaff.provost.wisc.edu/faculty-hiring-and-retention-resources/#anna-julia-cooper-postdoctoral-fellowship" target="_blank">Anna Julia Cooper</a> fellow at the <a href="https://www.aos.wisc.edu" target="_blank">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS), University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I will be starting as an Assistant Professor at AOS in Fall 2026.  
<br/>
I grew up in Baguio City in the Philippines and earned my B.S. in Physics, with a minor in Creative Writing, from <em>Ateneo de Manila University</em>. I worked at the Manila Observatory.  
<br/>
I received both my M.S. and my Ph.D. from the Department of Atmospheric Science at <em>Colorado State University</em>.  
<br/>
I'm passionate about science communication and justice in STEM, particularly related to the Global South. Outside of work, you can usually find me at the pottery studio, testing out a new recipe, or riding my bike somewhere beautiful!
