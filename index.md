Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/">Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University</a>.
<br/><br/>
My work explores <em>where</em> and <em>when</em> human-driven changes are most important for clouds. Anthropogenic activities perturb the aerosol environment through changes to emission sources (<em>think: factories, shipping</em>). At the same time, humans drive changes in the land surface (<em>think: deforestation, urbanization</em>). I examine how those combined perturbations to the earth system drive changes in cloud and precipitation properties. This is important for water availability, extreme weather, and the climate system. The interplay of microphysics, dynamics, and radiation involved makes it challenging to untangle the processes driving these aerosol-land-cloud interactions. Every cloud is different, and the balance of processes can be varied even within a single cloud field! However, understanding this variability and its ultimate effects is essential to <b>understanding how we are changing the weather and climate on the planet we live on</b>.

In my research, I use a combination of satellite data, field observations, and cloud-resolving models. I'm interested in how we can use new techniques and advances in computational power to better understand physical processes!
