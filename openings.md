<h1>Graduate Students</h1>
I am looking to recruit 1-2 M.S./Ph.D. students to join the new Land, Aerosol, and Cloud Interactions group at the University of Wisconsin–Madison starting Fall 2026. Applicants may apply through either [the M.S. or research Ph.D. program at the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS).](https://aos.wisc.edu/academics/graduate/) Tuition and stipend support will be provided.

Our research focuses on how human-driven changes to land cover and aerosol emissions impact clouds, storms, precipitation, and Earth’s radiation budget. To better understand the physical processes driving changes in clouds, we use a combination of high-resolution numerical models, satellite data, and field observations. 

Potential student research topics may include: 

- the diurnal cycle of convection over land
- aerosol modulation of land-atmosphere interactions
- other applications of land-aerosol-cloud interactions on real-world systems (e.g., solar energy generation, deforestation, urbanization, agricultural and/or land management practices)

Our ideal candidate is curious about cloud and storm physics and passionate about using science to inform future systems. We are looking for candidates with strong analysis, programming, and communication skills. We welcome students from all backgrounds, including (but not limited to) atmospheric science, meteorology, climate science, physics, mathematics, computer science, or environmental science. 

Interested applicants may email Bee (bee.leung@wisc.edu) with the subject heading “**Prospective Graduate Student Application**”. Please include a copy of your CV and brief description of research interests and background. Formal applications should be submitted via the [AOS admissions process](https://aos.wisc.edu/academics/graduate/admission/). The priority deadline for applications is 1 January 2026, but interested applicants are encouraged to contact Bee before submitting their formal applications.

<!--<h1>Undergraduate Students</h1>
There are <a href="https://teachlearn.wisc.edu/undergraduate-research/">many opportunities</a> for undergrads to get involved in research at UW–Madison! I am happy to work with undergraduate students to identify potential research projects.

<h1>Postdocs</h1>
I do not currently have funding for a postdoc, but am happy to meet with prospective applicants who want to apply for fellowships. Reach out to me via email (bee.leung@wisc.edu)!-->
