<h1>Graduate Students</h1>
I am looking to recruit 1-2 M.S./Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2026 to do research on <b>land surface impacts on convection</b>, <b>aerosol-cloud interactions</b>, and <b>the cloud diurnal cycle over land</b>. I currently have projects available for students who want to work with satellite data or numerical models (or both). Students will ideally have experience coding (our group primarily uses Python) and some coursework in physics, mathematics, computer science, environmental science and/or atmospheric science. <!--I do not require that applicants have extensive atmospheric science backgrounds——I had never taken an atmospheric science course before graduate school!-->

If you are interested in working with me, <b>reach out via email (bee.leung@wisc.edu) with the subject line "Prospective Graduate Student Application"</b>. In your email, please introduce yourself, describe your educational background, explain why you are interested in doing research in our group, and attach a recent CV/resume. I am happy to set up meetings with prospective students to discuss potential research projects.

To join our group at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS), you should submit an application to our <a href="https://aos.wisc.edu/academics/graduate/admission/">research graduate program</a>. Full applications submitted by <b>January 1st</b> receive the highest priority for Fall admission.

<!--<h1>Undergraduate Students</h1>
There are <a href="https://teachlearn.wisc.edu/undergraduate-research/">many opportunities</a> for undergrads to get involved in research at UW–Madison! I am happy to work with undergraduate students to identify potential research projects.

<h1>Postdocs</h1>
I do not currently have funding for a postdoc, but am happy to meet with prospective applicants who want to apply for fellowships. Reach out to me via email (bee.leung@wisc.edu)!-->
