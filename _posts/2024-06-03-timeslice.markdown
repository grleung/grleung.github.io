title:  "This summer, I'm helping lead a series of radiosonde launches as part of the TIME-SLICE campaign in preparation for the INCUS mission. Check out the rest of our team's instrumentation at our supersite in Northern Colorado <a href='https://incus.colostate.edu/time-slice'>here</a>! We've also been hosting a lot of K-12 outreach events associated with these launches."
