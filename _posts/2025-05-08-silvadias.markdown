The Silva Dias award is given annually by the CSU Atmospheric Science department to a senior PhD student for outstanding research. Bee says, "I'm very honored to win this prize for my work on deforestation impacts on clouds over Southeast Asia, especially since Maria Silva Dias did a lot of pioneering work on mesoscale meteorology and deforestation in the Amazon!"
