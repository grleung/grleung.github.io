title:  "I was chosen for the <a href='https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/2025/05/riehl-and-silva-dias-2025-awards-announced/'>Maria Silva Dias award</a>. The Silva Dias award is given annually by the CSU Atmospheric Science department to a senior PhD student for outstanding research. I'm very honored to win this prize for my work on deforestation impacts on clouds over Southeast Asia, especially since Maria Silva Dias did a lot of pioneering work on mesoscale meteorology and deforestation in the Amazon!"
